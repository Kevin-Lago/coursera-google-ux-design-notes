# Introduction

- The phrase "user experience" was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman, as technology use expanded and evolved.
- The principles of user experience actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China, where the practice of Feng Shui began.

# The Basics

- User experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.
- It might be a physical product, like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips, or a technology product, like an app, website, or smartwatch.
