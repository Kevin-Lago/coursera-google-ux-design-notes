# Introduction

- The phrase "user experience" was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman, as technology use expanded and evolved.
- The principles of user experience actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China, where the practice of Feng Shui began.

# The Basics

- User experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.
- It might be a physical product, like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips, or a technology product, like an app, website, or smartwatch.
- For example, for a user to have a good experience, the product needs to be usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.
- For example, today, the ketchup bottle has been redesigned into a plastic squeezable bottle, which makes it easier to use and allows users to control how much ketchup comes out.
- Think about ordering takeout food online. When you search for a restaurant in Google or Yelp, you can see photos of dishes and read reviews from other people who have eaten there. This experience is enjoyable because you can make a more informed choice about what to order, leaving you feeling happier about the product.
- To know how users feel, we have to collect evidence on how they're experiencing that product in real time and ask them about it, too.

# Jobs in the Field of User Experience

- UX researchers conduct the studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product. 
- UX writers, who think about how to make the language within a product clearer to make the user experience more intuitive.
- Production designers, who often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers. They make sure the first and final designs match in the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering team. The assets are everything from text and images to the design specifications, like font style, color, size, and spacing.
- UX engineers, one of the groups that UX designers work with most frequently. UX engineers translate the design's intent into a functioning experience, like a website or an app.
- UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.

# User Experience Careers

- Interaction designers focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They strive to understand the user flow, or the path, that a typical user takes to complete a task on an app, website, or other platform. At Google and many other companies, interaction designers are a specialized type of UX designer. 

    - An interaction designer's work answers questions like: What should happen if a user taps on this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the design elements within the website laid out? Interaction designers focus less on how the product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.

- Visual designers focus on how a product or technology looks. They are often responsible for designing logos, illustrations, and icons, as well as deciding on font color, size, and placement. Visual designers focus on the layout of each page or screen and make all of the design elements fit together in a visually appealing way. At Google and many other companies, visual designers are a specialized type of UX designer. 

    - The role of a visual designer is to answer questions like: What kind of visual style should icons have, in order to fit the product's branding? Or, which color and font should we use for this button? The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire, engage, and excite them.

- Motion designers think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or website. They may also create animations or visual effects to bring their design ideas to life. At Google and many other companies, motion designers are a specialized type of UX designer. 

    - A motion designer’s work answers questions like: How should an app transition between pages? How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging animation that will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.

- Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create products that provide users with immersive experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. Virtual reality involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. For example, VR can feel like you're entering the setting of a magical imaginary land. 

    - On the other hand, augmented reality uses the physical world as a backdrop and adds virtual elements on top of it. Users are still contextually aware of their surroundings, but their reality is augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements through a screen. For example, you can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can add digital images, like a new barstool or a piece of artwork, to the room around you.

    - A VR or AR designer’s work answers questions like: How do we create a user experience that leverages 3D space? Or, will this action cause a user motion sickness? To ensure users are comfortable immersing in a VR or AR experience, designers need to carefully consider everything from sound to lighting. 

- UX researchers conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. UX researchers often identify pain points that users are experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems. They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or website, for example. 

    - UX researchers answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this product easy to use? And, would people be interested in this new design feature? The goal of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users are having.

- UX writers think about how to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is more intuitive. UX writers also help define a brand’s voice and personality. The work of UX writers often includes writing labels for buttons and determining the tone of language used within an app or website.

    - UX writers focus on answering questions like: What words should be used to communicate this idea clearly? Should the tone for this app be friendly or technical? And, what should the language on this button label say? UX writers often become subject matter experts in order to present content that’s easy to understand for all users. 

- UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication, so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. This might include setting goals, writing project plans, and allocating team resources.

    - UX program managers answer questions like: What are the overall goals for this project, and what’s the plan to achieve them? And, how can we create and improve processes within the team? UX program managers work across departments to make sure that UX is involved throughout a project lifecycle.

- UX engineers translate the design’s intent into a functioning experience, like an app or a website. They help UX teams figure out if designs are intuitive and technically feasible.

    - UX engineers answer questions like: How do we implement each interaction? How do we build this design in a way that stays true to its original intent? And, how might we explore alternatives to determine the best user experience? UX engineers synthesize design and development, bringing product concepts to life. 

- Conversational interfaces are everywhere, from intelligent virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, to interactive voice response systems like customer service systems you can talk to. Conversational interfaces even include automobile navigation systems and chatbots! Conversation design incorporates natural, real-world conversational behaviors into the interactions between users and these systems. 

    - Conversation designers make it possible for users to have natural conversations to get things done. They leverage user research, psychology, technical knowledge, and linguistics to create user experiences that are intuitive and engaging. Conversation designers develop the “persona” or personality of the voice, as well as the flow and dialog of the interaction. 

    - Conversation designers answer questions like: What’s the ideal language and flow based on who users are, the task to be accomplished, and the context of the conversation? Does the personality of the virtual assistant seem genuine, engaging, and reflective of the brand values? How does the conversation work with on-screen elements? Does the virtual assistant offer a consistent, usable, and useful experience end-to-end? 

# Product Development Lifecycle

- The product development lifecycle is the process used to take a product from an idea to reality.
- There are five stages in the product development lifecycle.
    - **Brainstorm**: An active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have. During the brainstorm stage, the team generates ideas to solve a problem, understands the audience they're designing for, and identifies needs or challenges the audience may have. Research plays a key role in this first stage because you're exploring different ways to get to know the audience you're designing for. UX researchers and writers are often heavily involved in this stage, where the team might conduct interviews with potential users or conduct other research.
    - **Define**: All about using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus. During the define stage, the team determines concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user. As a UX designer, you'll begin to think more about specific details related to the product, who the product is for, what the product will do, and what features need to be included for the product to be successful. Statements that outline the goals or outline any problems you want to answer with the product design are the focus in the define stage.
    - **Design**: UX designers begin to actively develop ideas, and they also check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic. The first two stages are more about preparation and planning. They give you a clear understanding of who the user is, what the user wants, and which problems or challenges you want to address in your design. Using the insights from the first two stages, UX designers generate designs that keep the user top of mind. You'll create many different assets, including storyboards, which are sketches that help explore the user's experience, or wireframes, which provide outlines of the content layout. Or you might create prototypes, which are models that allow UX designers to test the functionality of a design. All of these things will be covered later in the program.
    - **Test**: The team evaluates the product design based on feedback from potential users. Testing designs with users is really important because it helps the team focus on the user first and foremost and the designs second. Testing helps identify areas to refine or improve the designs. It also helps UX designers consider the interactivity of the design. This is a stage that involves lots of interaction between UX designers and front-end engineers as they figure out ways to create an end product that satisfies users' needs and is practical and functional. They discuss things like how the color or font can fit the company's brand or whether the prototype designs are easily understandable.
    - **Launch**: Sharing a finished version of the product with the public. This might involve listing an app in the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store, making a website go live, or putting a physical product on store shelves. Launching can be very satisfying for you and your team because you have the chance to understand how your designs will be received in the real world. However, the work on a product isn't quite finished after launch. You may still identify opportunities to improve on the designs or learn even more about the user experience based on feedback. This could involve going back to the design or testing stages and figuring out ways to produce a more enhanced version of the product.
