# Introduction to Design Sprints

- **Design Sprint**: A design sprint is a time-based process, with five phases typcially spread over 5 full 8-hour days.

The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping and testing ideas with users.

Design sprints generally include 5 phases:
    - Understand
    - Ideate
    - Decide
    - Prototype
    - Test

Design sprints are designed to save time, create a path to bring a product to market, prioritize the user and test the product before launch.

# The Five Phases of Design Sprints

- **Understand**:

- **Ideate**:

- **Decide**:

- **Prototpye**:

- **Test**:

# Benefits of Design Sprints

- It's all about the user
- Value every person in the room
- The best ideas rise to the top
- Time to focus
- Lower Risks
- Versatile Scheduling

# Plan Design Sprints

- **Step 1**: User research is the first step in any sprint planner process. Get a rough idea of what your sprint will focus on. It'll help decide which research methods make the most sense.

- **Step 2**: If you're planning the sprint, It's up to you to schedule short talks with colleagues or industry experts. This helps clarify the problem your spring is trying to solve.

- **Step 3**: Find the right space. It's important to ensure that the space allows all employees equal opportunities to perform their job. Whiteboards are a great way to capture ideas or hand sticky notes. Acoustics are important to consider to participants can hear each other. Comfortable furniture that can move around easily can help collaboration. If you're planning the design sprint, it's your job to make sure everyone has what they need to participate.

- **Step 4**: Gather the supplies you'll need for the sprint. You'll need supplies like markers, sticky notes, snacks, water, ect..

- **Step 5**: Establish the rules of the sprint. These can include not allowing personal gadgets to prevent distractions.

- **Step 6**: Plan introductions! This can be important since sprints involve cross-functional teams that may have never met before.

# The Design Spring Brief

- **Sprint Brief**: A document that you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the spring.

# Retrospectives 

A retrospective is a collaborative critique of the design sprint. The goal of a retrospective is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has the chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improvement. 

Start the retrospective by discussing the parts of the design sprint that were successful and areas where the team did well. Maybe a new process was created that could be applied to future sprints. Or maybe the addition of a new digital tool enhanced the team’s productivity. Analyze your team’s wins, and think about how they could be applied to future sprints.

After highlighting everything that went well, it’s time to shift gears and think about areas for improvement. Your team will want to know what went wrong, so that you all can do better next time. 

Encourage everyone to participate in sharing areas for improvement. You might even take turns going around a circle and adding challenges to a shared list. If anyone is nervous about speaking up, invite each person to write their thoughts anonymously on individual sticky notes. Then, all of the improvements can be reviewed together. This eliminates concerns about causing offense and reduces the chance of groupthink. Groupthink can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic. Groupthink prevents each person from having an equal say, and it might mean certain areas for improvement are overlooked.

By the end of the retrospective meeting, your team will have a better understanding of what went well and what could be improved. Naturally, you’ll want to take lessons learned into your next design sprint. 

Before your next sprint, review the conclusions you reached at the end of the last retrospective. Your conclusions should inform how you conduct the next sprint. Perhaps you need to include a more diverse team, allow more time for ideating, or test with additional users before moving forward with a design.
