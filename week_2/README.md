# User Centered Design

"There is no substitute for personally watching and listening to real people." - Larry Page

- **Understand**: Understand how the user experiences the product.

- **Specify**: Specify the end user's needs.

- **Design**: Design solutions to the end user's problem.

- **Evaluate**: Evaluate your design against your end user's needs.

# Assitive Technology 

Assisitive technologies is used to describe any products, equipment, and system that enhance learning, working and daily living for people with disibilities.

Some examples include:
    - Prostheitcs
    - Pointing Devices
    - Elecrtic Wheelchairs
    - Power Lifts
    - Eye and Head Trackers
    - ect.

# Design Thinking: UX Design Framework

- **Empathize**: During the empathize phase, your primary goal is to learn more about the user and their problems, wants, and needs, and the environment or context in which they’ll experience your design. The most important part of the empathize phase is to step away from your assumptions and guesses and let your research findings inform your decision-making in later design phases.

- **Define**: In the define phase, you’ll analyze your research findings from the empathize phase and determine which user problems are the most important ones to solve, and why. This will drive you toward a clear goal for the design of the product.

- **Ideate**: Ideation involves collaborative brainstorming with other members of your team to generate as many solutions as possible to a problem. This could include marketing, engineering, product management, or any other stakeholders for the product or service. During brainstorming sessions, you should explore all possible solutions. Don’t focus on whether something is a “good” or “bad” idea, just collect as many ideas as you can. The important thing here is to keep this process judgment-free.

- **Prototype**: After you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the prototype phase, where your goal is to produce an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality and can be used for testing. The test phase is critical to developing the right solution to address your user’s problem, and an organized approach to testing can help you create exceptional user experiences.

- **Test**: Prototyping and testing are  interconnected, which means that you’ll  test your designs at each stage of prototype development rather than waiting to test until after the working prototype is complete. If the design is too polished the first time you present it to users, you might not get as much feedback. Think about ways to include testing throughout the design process, so that you’re iterating your designs based on user feedback instead of other reasons. 

# Universal Design, Inclusive Design and Equity-Focused Design

- **Universal Design**: The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations.

- **Inclusive Design**: Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like:
    - Ability
    - Race
    - Economic status
    - Language
    - Age

- **Equity-Focused Design**: Desigining for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.

# Designing Cross-Platform Experiences

When designing a new product or feature, it's important to think about the different types of platforms that the design will be experienced on. As a refresher, a platform is the medium that users experience your product. Some common platforms are:

- Desktop Computers
- Laptop Computers
- Mobile Phones
- Tablets
- Wearables (Smart Watches)
- TVs
- Smart Displays

### **Screen Size**

The first consideration when designing for various platforms is adjusting design elements and features to fit different screen sizes. For example, you have a lot of screen space when you design for desktop and laptop computers. But when you design for smaller screens, like mobile phones, you have to carefully decide which parts of the design you'll prioritize including in the limited space. This means making every word, icon, and image count!

### **Interaction**

In addition to the size of the screen, you also need to consider the way users interact with each platform and how those interactions might affect your design decisions. 

### **Content Layout**

In the world of UX design, layouts refer to the way that information is organized on the screen. For example, when designing for desktop or laptop computers, you have the advantage of working with a familiar, standardized size: landscape (horizontal) mode. The screen is wide, content can be laid out in columns, and there’s much more flexibility to design. 

### **Functionality**

There are a lot of reasons why users might choose one platform over another, but functionality and the kind of tasks they want to complete is a huge driver. Your designs for each platform will likely vary based on how and when you expect users to need the product.
